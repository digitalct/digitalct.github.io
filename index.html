Hello
<strong>unknown@103.232.241.182</strong>.
So nice of you to stop by.<a href="name/"></a>
</p>

<p>
I'm a member of the <a href="http://zippy.ph.utexas.edu/index.html">
Theory Group</a> here at UT. I've been at UT since September 1994. Before
coming here, I was an Assistant Professor in the theory group at
<a href="http://puhep1.princeton.edu/">Princeton</a>.
</p>

<p>
My research interests are in string theory, quantum field theory and 
mathematical physics. If you want to learn more about what I do, you
might want to look at my 
<a
href="http://inspirehep.net/search?p=fin+a+distler%2Cj">
publications</a>.
</p>

<p>
These are exciting times to be a theorist. It is fair to say that we really don't yet know what string theory is about, but we are learning.
</p>

<h2>Useful stuff . . .</h2>
<p>
I've written, or am the maintainer of several pieces of open-source software. These projects can be
found in my <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/code/">Source Code Repository</a>. 
<a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/wiki/instiki/show/HomePage">Instiki</a> and <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/forum/">Heterotic Beast</a>
are, respectively, wiki and forum software geared to the needs of physicists and mathematicians. In particular, they provide LaTeX-like
support for mathematical equations, via <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/itex2MMLcommands.html">itex2MML</a>.
I've also written my own <a href="TeXstuff/utarticle.cls">article class</a> for 
LaTeX2e because the existing defaults are so unspeakably ugly. As a companion
to this, I've written a <a
href="http://arxiv.org/hypertex/">HyperTeX</a>-aware BibTeX <a
href="code/utphys/">style file</a>. You can grab references in BibTeX
format from <a href="http://inspirehep.net/">inSPIRE</a>
and use them in your paper with essentially no retyping. And, in the height
of coolness, e-print references automatically become clickable hyperlinks to
the paper at the <a href="http://arXiv.org"><tt>arXiv.org</tt></a>
e-print archives.
</p>

<p>
For many years, Golem was a NeXTStep machine. It was a lovely operating system,
but it had more than its fair share of <a href="progs/index.html">security
holes</a>. In mid-2001, Golem migrated to a G4 running MacOSX, a much more 
modern operating system. <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000497.html">Golem III</a> was a
burly dual processor G5, which died a spectacular death, due to a CPU coolant leak.
<a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/002211.html">Golem IV</a> was a more demure 27" iMac.
<a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/002763.html">Golem V</a> is a Mac Mini, housed at the UT Data Center.
</p> 

<p>
Classic MacOS things that seemed useful once upon a time include this
<a href="MacStuff/EudoraNicknameIAD.html"> Internet Address Detector</a>
and the venerable Macintosh version of the Los Alamos
<a href="MacStuff/uufiles.hqx">uufiles</a> utility.

<a href="http://www.austinlinks.com/">Austin</a> is a 
really cool town. It has an impressive 
<a href="http://www.austinlinks.com/Arts/">Arts
scene</a>, great

restaurants</a> and an amazing number of

My wife Suzanne and I are enjoying living here a lot.
